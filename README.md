# How to use

This requires Amazon Q CLI, and create a custom agent together with supporting files to mimic how Kiro works.

1. Git clone this repo into a fresh directory
2. From this directory, launch Amazon Q CLI with the following command "q chat --agent kiro"
3. Your CLI will now behave like Kiro - you can ask it to implement a spec by typing "create a new spec to do xx"
4. The Kiro workflow will now start - you will need to use the chat to move it through the workflow steps
